This project is a lightweight website intelligence scraper that converts a company website URL into a structured Company Info Record.

                               What This Project Does

Given a company website URL, the scraper:

Extracts company identity

Company name

Website URL

Tagline / one-liner (best-effort)

Generates a business summary

Sample text describing what the company does

Detects key business pages

About, Products, Solutions, Careers, Contact

Collects evidence & proof signals

Social media links (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, YouTube, Instagram)

Extracts contact information

Emails

Phone numbers

Outputs everything as a structured JSON file

Logs timestamp and scraping notes for transparency

                                        Page Selection Strategy

The scraper does not crawl the entire website. It prioritizes high-signal pages commonly used to describe a company’s business, such as About, Products, Services, Careers, and Contact pages. Internal links from the homepage are filtered using intent-based keywords, and crawling is limited to a maximum of 15 pages to ensure efficiency and reliability.

                      How to Run-

                          Limitations & Design Decisions (Intentional)

This scraper is honest by design and avoids hallucination.

JS-heavy websites
Content rendered entirely via JavaScript may not be fully visible using HTML fetching.

No login / gated pages
Only publicly accessible pages are scraped. Pages behind authentication are skipped.

Limited crawling scope
The scraper checks a maximum of common business pages (/about, /products, /solutions, /careers, /contact) instead of deep crawling.

Best-effort extraction
If a signal is not found, it is explicitly marked as "Not found" rather than guessed.
